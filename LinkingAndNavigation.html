		<h2 id="URL">URLs </h2>
			Determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not
			enough to make a web page look good and interactive.So you'll use assisted 
			technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and 
			add interactivity, respectively.
		<h2 id="SourceAnchors">Source Anchors</h2>
			Consists of the opening tag, a character, the content, and a closing tag.
			Some elements are empty â€“ that is, they don't have a closing tag but instead have
			a source or link to content that you want to embed on the web page.
		<h2 id="DestinationAnchors">DestinationAnchors</h2>
			Elements are often used interchangeably with tags, but there's a small difference
			between the two. An element is a combination of the opening and closing tag, and 
			then the content between them.
		<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>
			 Tags also take what are called attributes. These attributes are placed in the 
			opening tag and range from style and ids to classes. They take values, which convey 
			more information about the element and help you do things such as styling and 
			manipulation with JavaScript.
